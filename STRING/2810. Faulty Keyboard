Your laptop keyboard is faulty, and whenever you type a character 'i' on it, it reverses the string that you have written. Typing other characters works as expected.

You are given a 0-indexed string s, and you type each character of s using your faulty keyboard.

















class Solution {
public:
    string finalString(string s) {
        int n=s.size();
        string ans="";

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(s[i]=='i')
            {
                reverse(ans.begin(),ans.end());
            }
            else{
                ans=ans+s[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
